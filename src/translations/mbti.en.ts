Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical \
sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they \
are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design \
and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. \
Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty \
and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t \
box me in!”",
      ISTJ: "\
  The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, \
  making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics \
  of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make \
  Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations \
  that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory \
  bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy \
  taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they \
  do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their \
  time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.",
      ISTP: "\
  Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, \
  touching and examining the world around them with cool \
  rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality \
  type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, \
  building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, \
  and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics \
  and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their \
  hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, \
  just a little bit better than they were before.",
      INTJ: "\
  It can be lonely at the top. Being one of the rarest personality types \
  and being among the most capable people, Architects know this all too \
  well. They make up just two percent of the population, and women with this \
  personality type are especially rare, forming only 0.8%. It can be difficult \
  for Architects to find people who can keep up with their non-stop analysis \
  of things. People with this personality type are imaginative yet decisive... \
  ambitious yet like their privacy... curious about everything but remain focused.",
      INFJ: "\
  The Advocate personality type is very rare, making up less than one percent of \
  the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world. Advocates \
  have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is that \
  they are not idle dreamers. These individuals are capable of taking concrete \
  steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact. \
  People with this personality type tend to see helping others as their purpose in life. \
  Advocates can often be found engaging in rescue efforts and doing charity work. \
  However, their real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people  \
  need not be rescued at all.",
      ENFJ: "\
  Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming \
  around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our \
  coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and \
  to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, \
  Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work \
  together to improve themselves and their community.",
      ESFJ: "\
  People who share the Consul personality type are, for lack of a better word, \
  popular – which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality \
  type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, Consuls are \
  the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight \
  and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, Consuls \
  continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social \
  gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.",
      ESTJ: "\
  Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their \
  understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring \
  families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication \
  and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for \
  their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult \
  paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on \
  roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in \
  celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values \
  that hold families and communities together.",
      ENTJ: "\
  Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody \
  the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that \
  draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also \
  characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, \
  determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. \
  Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest \
  they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much \
  of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the \
  businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.",
      ENTP: "\
  The Debater personality type is the ultimate devil’s advocate, thriving on \
  the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift \
  in the wind for all to see. Debaters don’t do this because they are trying \
  to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, but for the simple reason \
  that it’s fun. No one loves the process of mental sparring more than Debaters, \
  as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad \
  accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to \
  prove their points.",
      INTP: "\
  The Logician personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of \
  the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing \
  they’d be more unhappy about than being “common”. Logicians pride themselves \
  on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous \
  intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy \
  professor, Logicians have been responsible for many scientific discoveries \
  throughout history.",
      ENFP: "\
  The Campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life \
  of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners \
  are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment \
  than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make \
  with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% \
  of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.",
      INFP: "\
  Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint \
  of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to \
  make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or \
  even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. \
  Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood \
  is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they \
  find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel \
  will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.",
      ISFJ: "\
  The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities \
  defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders \
  have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed \
  people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally \
  a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. \
  As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more \
  than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths \
  that defines who they are.",
      ESTP: "\
  Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – \
  the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy \
  of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing \
  and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities \
  love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come \
  on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend. Theory, \
  abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their \
  implications don’t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long. Entrepreneurs \
  keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but \
  they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. \
  Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather \
  than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.",
      ESFP: "\
  If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it \
  is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the \
  excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. \
  No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as \
  Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality \
  type does it with such irresistible style.",
